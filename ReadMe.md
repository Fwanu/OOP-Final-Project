# BAP (Beadle Assistance Program)

is a program made by my team, I don't know what their name is...

Its main objective and purpose is to help Beadles in recording and monitoring attendance of their fellow students.

## Main Features:
  - Can record up to 11 students and up to 16 days (expanding is still wip)
  - Records students' status can easily be seen and adjusted by a click of a button
  - Adjustable student names
  - Can export list of students' current stats (Name, Dates Recorded, Present, Absent, Total Days Present, Total Days Absent)

## Installation:
  - Just download the file as zip and unpack in the same file.
  - Assets/Frame0 might not be exported as a folder in a folder, please do so if its not
  - Check masterfile.text for previous recordings. Multiple recordings might make distinction difficult. Delete at your own leisure

## How to Run:
  1. Open program
  2. input two dates with the date start being higher than the date end
  3. the two values will generate all values from date start to date end as value to record
  4. press the leftmost buttons to set the names
  5. press the buttons underneath the columns to set the user in row as absent or present. (grey is defaulted as absent. Green present, red absent)
  6. Once satisfied with the recordings, press the export button
